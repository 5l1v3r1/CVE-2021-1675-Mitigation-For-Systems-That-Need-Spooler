# CVE-2021-1675-Mitigation-For-Systems-That-Need-Spooler
A temporary mitigation to the CVE-2021-1675. Print Spooler will be disabled during non-business hours. 

The idea is too automatically disabled the 'spooler' service inside of Windows when users will not be onsite or needing a print server. 

This was achived by creating powershell scripts that stop and start the service 'spooler'. Next, create tasks in 'Task Scheduler' to run the script to disable the spooler service at 6PM everyday.
